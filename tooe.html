          <h3>Book Review: The Origins of Efficiency</h3>
          <h5>5 February 2026</h5>
          <img src="./imgs/tooe.jpg" />
          <p>Another review, and I quite enjoyed this one! It almost went too fast. But first, some life updates. I've been going to Jailhouse (a climbing crag) on the weekends a lot recently, and it's kind of been chewing me up. I was actually supposed to go for a run today (the 4th, but this review will release on the 5th); but have just been feeling kind of beat from the climbing. I set 10 personal goals this year; it's really sunken in that I need to make 3% progress on one goal every day. For some, which are accomplished in discrete events, that's manageable; but for others, I need to make consistent progress. For example, my running goal was 200 hours and completing a 100k race (Dick Collins); so one hour of running nets me...0.25% of the goal. Oof... I'm mentioning this because one of my two reading goals is to read all the Stripe Press books and write a review for each, and I am stitting at ~13.5/19 done with 4/19 reviews completed. About halfway. But it being February and all, I was supposed to finish a goal by now.</p>
          <p>Back to the book. This book is in the "how to do things" category from Stripe Press (it was commissioned by them, not a reprint of an old classic), and features a more "Progress Studies"-adjacent author in Brian Potter, who is currently a fellow at the Institute For Progress, a DC think tank. It describes the elements of a production process, ways to improve each element (make production more efficient), common frameworks to accomplish the different ways, patterns that have emerged, and finally, why some things fail to become more efficient. In other words, remember the show <i>How It's Made</i>? It's that.</p>
          <p>The book very much feels like a textbook for an intro course that's missing some equations and practice problems, <i>Factory Efficiency 101</i> or something like that. I mean that as words of praise, I was engrossed the whole time! In fact, I wish it was a bit longer and had some of those elements, but I understand Stripe is trying to turn a profit here, which means once Brian hits that magical 300 page mark, you know the book is almost over. Each chapter described ways steps in a process are removed, product parts are combined, step variation is reduced, scale achieved, costs reduced with learning, buffers eliminated, and so on. Three examples it repeatedly comes back to are nail production, glass bulb production, and Ford's Model T (so much so that I wish there were some visual aids <i>a la</i> How It's Made, but Brian does a serviceable job with his descriptions). Moore's Law-like gains in efficiency seem to lie around every corner: 50x productive machines, 90% reductions in cost, 50% reduction in time taken, and so on. As I read on, I really soaked in just how tremendous and hard-fought the last 200 years of productivity improvements and technological progress have been. The various chapters contain some of the most important processes in modern life: iron production, steel production, cars, penecillin, books. The opening chapter focuses on the past, describing the absolute destitution, literally a handful of posessions and wearing clothes that took hundreds of hours of labor, that people in the past lived in. The closing chapter, in turn, paints an optimistic picture of productivity gains using near-future tech like AI-powered simulations, self-driving vehicles, and humanoid robots, in one of the last inefficient domains, housing.</p>
          <p>Some weaker parts are the summary sections at the end of each chapter, which occasionally read like an impact section or simply obligatory rather than a part-by-part summary, and the aforementioned lack of diagrams. This book, more than others, felt adaptable to a video series or movie.</p>
          <p>Here's the summary.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Introduction: defining production efficiency; penicillin example from discovery to mass production; </li>
            <li>Chapter 1: Lick's early life, the Psycho-Acoustics lab at Harvard in WW2, meeting/marrying Louise, Norbert Weiner at MIT.</li>
            <li>Chapter 2: Bush's WW2 efforts and analog computer, Shannon's circuits/boolean logic, Weiner plea to modernize computers as digital, electronic, binary, and programmable. Von Neumann and Machly/Eckert and ENIAC. McCulloch/Pitts neural nets. Turing and turing machines/halting problem. Weiner's feedback, Von Neumanns EDVAC draft with the "stored program" code-as-data idea.</li>
            <li>Chapter 3: Lick and Miller's opposition to Skinner's behaviourism (the mind exists and stores models). Shannon's information theory, Weiner's cybernetics. Von Neumann completes his first draft.</li>
            <li>Chapter 4: Forrester and Whirlwind computer -> Project Lincoln, Lick moves to RLE/Whirlwind at MIT. SAGE system from Project Lincoln. Turing, Wiener, von Neumann die. Miller, Newell, and Chomsky end behaviorism. Newell and Simon's Logic Theorist (first AI, based on heuristics). Wes Clark brings Lick to BBN.</li>
            <li>Chapter 5: Lick experiences interactive computing with the TX-2 and TX-0, realizes 85% of his thinking time is rote calculation. BBN develops LGP-30 but it dissapoints. DEC's PDP-1 dissapoints. McCarthy invents LISP; then demonstrates time-sharing on an IBM 704. Lick writes <i>Man-Computer Symbiosis</i>. Wes Clark develops the LINC at the Lincoln lab, is linked to Q-32 at SDC in california. Corbato develops CTSS.</li>
            <li>Chapter 6: ARPA comes into existence after the Sputnik launch. Ruina appoints Lick as its first director, with Lick pitching man-computer-symbiosis as key to solving command-and-control woes. Lick 'invites proposals'; funds his MIT friends, Perlis at Carnegie, Fredkin at SDC with his Q-32, RAND, Feigenbaum at Berkeley, and Engelbart at SRI. The MIT effort evolves into Project MAC (CTSS->Multics). Lick writes the <i>Intergalactic Network</i> memo. Timesharing at Project MAC includes hundreds of users. Corbato eventually selects GE for its next computer, shocking IBM. Lick selects Sutherland as his successor. Lick goes to IBM.</li>
            <li>Chapter 7: Taylor succeeds Sutherland, and initiates the ARPAnet (with help from asst Larry Roberts). At regular meetings of principals, they resolve to do a store-and-forward (packet-based) network. Planning and budgets at IPTO and ARPA continue despite Vietnam. SRI, Utah, Santa Barbara, and UCLA are the first four nodes. Meanwhile, Engelbart gives his 'mother of all demos'. The idea was routers comes into being (as "IMPs") and the first few are installed. Lick leaves IBM after a year and goes to Project MAC; Multics is going poorly. 1972 ICCC demonstration of ARPAnet goes well.</li>
            <li>Chapter 8: Goldman and Pake form and direct Xerox PARC. Taylor joins. Starkweather invents laser printing. They hire a bunch of familiar faces, incl Lampson from Berkeley. Alan Kay joins with his Dynabook idea which evolves into the Alto (Smalltalk language, windows/icons GUI, pixel screen, desk form factor, ethernet). Metcalfe invents ethernet, based off the ALOHAnet. Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf design TCP/IP and install many more IMPs. Beancounters originally from Ford slowly kill funding and talent moves elsewhere in the early 80s. Lukasik gets email at the pentagon and ARPAnet support grows. Lick emergency-rejoins ARPA as director, but dealing with Heilmeier and Vietname makes ARPA become DARPA and requires relevances statements.</li>
            <li>Chapter 9: Lick returns as director to Project MAC, but is a poor manager and is demoted to research. Lick writes his "Multinet" article presaging the internet. Computing advances lead to the end of batch processing and the rise of personal computing, through DEC's PDP-line and VAX followed by the Apple II (Steve Jobs would visit PARC and see the Alot, inspired) and IBM PC, but these machines are not interactive until Lisa and MS-DOS. The ARPAnet merges with other local area networks, helped along by NSF funding, forming the internet. Lick continues to tinker as professor emeritus as MIT until his death.</li>
            <li>Addendum: three essays by Lick are included: "Man-computer Symbiosis", "Intergalactic Network", and "The computer as a communication device".</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Here are my takeaways.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Learning rates require uninterrupted production, working best with small, independent steps. This made intuitive sense and built a nice mental model for why Nuclear Power Plants haven't gotten cheper, but RAM and soybeans (my selections) have. </li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
          </ul>
          <p>One last note: the book sounds dry, but I felt the pathos. Maybe it was all that Factorio I played last year (it's pretty good at contextualizing certain concepts from the book, like buffers and push-versus-pull supply chains). But this stuff matters, and is part of the glorious symphony of spontaneous complexity that has lead to those cheap, cheap crunchwrap supremes I love so much.</p>
          <p>I'm now reading <i>The Origins of Efficiency</i> by Brian Potter. Just 7 books left! It's all moving so fast now, I can feel the momentum building.</p>
