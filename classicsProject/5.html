You enter the modest rowboat, which has rope, oars, a compass, a small sail, and a box with enough food for a few days. You quickly untie the boat and row away. You row for one day going west, then come upon an interesting sight.
<br />
On your left is a massive floating garbage patch, so massive fog obscures the other side of it.  The patch slowly rotates, and you notice other boats caught in the swirl. 
<br />
On your right is a towering rock structure that is too small to be considered an island, and is completely barren. Nevertheless, it would be nice to sleep on land tonight, so you land your boat at the base of the structure. You decide to climb to the top of the structure to get a better view of the area, but fog obscures your view. On the descent, you roll your ankle. You make a meager fire, dry your clothes, and sleep.
<br />
The next day, you wake up, still dealing with the impaired walking from rolling your ankle, and get back in your boat.
