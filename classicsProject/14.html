Two train rides later, you are finally in your hometown of Trat. You excitedly walk to your old home: it has been three long years. Your son will have graduated school and should be working in town or on the family farm. Your wife will be thrilled to see you.
<br />
The first person to recognize you is your dog, which embraces you in your yard.
<br />
You walk up to the door and knock. The door opens; it’s your son. He embraces you, but your wife is slower: she is across the room, holding hands with another man. She explains that, after you were abducted she found love again. Understanding the complexity of her situation and not wanting to budge, you give her space and decide to get a bite to eat with your son. He did well in school despite your absence and will be attending university in the fall. Still the owner of your home, you uneasily sleep on the sofa while your wife decides to sleep alone.
<br />
The next day, you discuss the predicament with your wife’s new husband. You learn that your wife has moved on, but she and him understand if you want to continue your relationship with your son. You decide, painstakingly, that that is the best course of action. Your wife moves into an apartment with her new partner, while your son stays at home with you.
<br />
