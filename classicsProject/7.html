<p>You sail north for two days, tired, waiting for your ankle to heal, and worrying about an uncertain future. Eventually you come across a luscious atoll with a small village. You row towards it, and the inhabitants welcome you by coming out of their houses and waving you forward. A women meets you enthusiastically upon beaching, but you cannot make out what she says: she speaks a foreign tongue.</p>
<p>You are warmly received by the rest of the villagers, who seem to not question their strange visitor. The houses are made of brick and the amenities on this island are surprisingly modern: plumbing, electricity, and plenty of food. You are invited to the primary women’s home, bathe and shave, and have a restful sleep.</p>
<p>The next day, you decide to stay on this island until you are fully recuperated, perhaps a week. You struggle to learn the native language, but do learn that your host’s name is Circe. You also notice that despite the modern amenities, there is no cell tower or other way to communicate with outside the island.</p>
<p>A week passes, and you decide to check upon your boat and perhaps leave. Funnily enough, your rowboat is no longer on the beach. “They must’ve moved it. I can inquire about its location tomorrow” you think.</p>
<p>A month passes. Life is very comfortable, and you contemplate staying. You can speak fragments of the language, and you decide to stay for a little longer. But then you remember your wife and son: they are surely still alive, and you are still able to return home. You must return! You decide to leave the island.</p>
<p>Upon bringing up this idea, Circe reacts with disdain. Seeing as she is a sort of leader on this island, you decide it would be a bad idea to bring up the idea again. In the middle of the night, you perform a wider search of the island for your initial boat. You find it in a sort of storage shed on the other side of the island. Unsure why it is there, or the true nature of this remote island, you must make a decision.</p>
