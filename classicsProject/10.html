You sail east for three days. You must ration your remaining food; it can last at most five more days. Five days pass, and still you do not sight any land. Desperate, you resolve to pray and meditate.
<br />
Another day passes, and no sign of land. You change course, and head north.
<br />
Another day passes, and hunger and thirst is beginning to set in. You continue to pray and meditate.
<br />
Another day passes, and you feel yourself slipping into a stupor.
<br />
Another day passes, and while praying, you see a vision: it is your school teacher, scolding you for being late to class. You realize you are in a dreamlike state and ask her for advice. She advises you to talk with your father and friends: after all, you are in your hometown in your dream. You go on to talk to your father, who advises you to continue going north. Your other friends agree.
<br />
You awake with an unusual clarity  considering your state of affairs.
