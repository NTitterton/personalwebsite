<p>You decide to seize the opportunity and bite into the fruit. The fruit tastes amazing and succulent, and you move on to shoveling the rest of that branch’s crop into your mouth. Slowly you feel sleepy, and pass out in the tall grass.</p>
<p>When you wake up, and have an intense craving for the taste of this fruit. You go to another tree and feast until you once again pass out.</p>
<p>Upon waking up again, you are now lying on the ground in a small brick house. All around you lie a half dozen similarly deposed individuals: some gnawing at the shackles that bind them. A worker of some kind enters and explains that the fruit you ate is extremely addictive and the island you’ve arrived on is actually the western edge of the massive island Kalimantan, in Indonesia. You are in a rehabilitation center for those who take the more concentrated version of the drug: Qat. You have little appetite or desire except for more of the fruit, deciding that it is best for you to stay here for now.</p>
