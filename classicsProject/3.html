You creak open the door and gaze at the contents of the hut: plenty of fish, some strange fruit, possibly from unseen plants on the island.
<br />
A loud voice grumbles from deeper in the hut, “Who goes there?!”
<br />
You respond “A wayward traveler. May Buddha bless you today. Who am I speaking with?”
<br />
The voice reveals himself from behind a curtain to be a tall, hulking man, with tanned skin and a strong brow. He bellows back, “Buddha? We do not respect any Buddha here! My name is Polyphemus, and there is no room on this island for any wayward soul. What have you really come for, intruder?”
<br />
You notice that one of Polyphemus’ eyes is missing, with a huge gash across that side of his face. Polyphemus ended his speech by striking me in the head. You wake up some time later tied to a tree right outside the hut. Luckily there is a sword of Polyphemus’ within reach, which you use to cut open the ropes that bound you.
