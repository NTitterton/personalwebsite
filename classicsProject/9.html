Sailing south, you come across a benign atoll. The weather has become too rough to continue to sail, so you beach upon the island. Once there, you discover enough fruit to get by, and a cave to take shelter from the weather.
<br />
The rain escalates into a monsoon, so you hunker down in the cave. What seems like days pass, and still the storm will not relent. Alone with your thoughts, you lament your lonely wife and son, and how long it has been without them. Hope seems bleak. 
<br />
After a week, the monsoon subsides and a boat appears on the shore. It is a rescue boat! Well equipped, with a few crew and plenty of supplies. One of the rescue workers jumps onto the beach and you great him.
<br />
He explains that he is employed by the government of Malaysia, and is visiting nearby islands after the monsoon for shipwrecks. Having found you, he offers to take you back to a waiting facility.
