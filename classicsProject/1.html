<p>Your name is Maung Toe, a 42-year-old Thai man who was abducted and forced to work as a fisherman for six months in the Java Sea. Your captors were cruel, and you are alone and tired. Your ultimate goal is to return home to your wife and adult son. You have jumped overboard and swam ashore to a small rocky island. There you see two things: a wooden hut, and a motorboat tied to a dock next to it. What do you do?</p>
