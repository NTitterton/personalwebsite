<p>You decide to stay and rest longer, returning to Circe’s home. Your guest bed is nice. You fall asleep.</p>
<p>In the later weeks, you learn that the island has a mysteriously successful fishing operation that explains its relative wealth. “That is okay”, you think to yourself. You can discover more details later. Weeks become months, and months become years, and you develop a restful life on the island, losing memory of how you arrived or what your life was like before the island.</p>
